		<h2>About Pusheen</h2>

			<p>Pusheen is a female cartoon cat who is the subject of comic strips and sticker sets on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media websites. Pusheen was created in 2010 by Claire Belton and Andrew Duff for a comic strip on their website, Everyday Cute. <br><br>

				More recently, the Pusheen character has been used in social media posts and on the Pusheen blog.

On the official Pusheen website, Pusheen is described as being a female cat who loves blogging, snacking, and going on adventures. <br><br>

The original comic strip series included characters modeled after Belton, Duff, their dog named Carm (short for “Carmen”), and Pusheen, a chubby grey tabby cat based on Belton's cat that now lives with her parents in Oregon. <br><br>

Pusheen's name stems from the word puisín, which means kitten in Irish. Occasionally, Pusheen and her sister Stormy are drawn in different themes, such as Pusheenosaurus Rex, where Pusheen is a dinosaur and Stormy is in a dinosaur egg. <br><br>

She can also be a Pushicorn, Purrmaid, and many other themes. Pusheen has a mom, dad, husband, a sister named Stormy, a brother named Pip, two kids, and an array of furry friends, including Sloth the sloth, Bo the parakeet, and Cheek the hamster.</p>
